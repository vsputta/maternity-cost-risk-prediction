# Maternity Cost & Risk Prediction for Healthcare Payers 
### Healthcare Payer Strategy & Predictive Modeling Project  

Healthcare payer analytics project simulating real-world cost reduction strategy using maternity claims data (~2,000 episodes).
Built to mirror analytics work done in payer strategy, consulting, and health-tech product teams.


---

## Business Problem
Pregnancy episodes are one of the highest cost drivers for commercial health plans.  
However, most payers only identify high-risk pregnancies **after costs have already occurred**.

This project builds an end-to-end analytics and predictive model to:

- Identify high-cost pregnancy drivers  
- Predict which pregnancies will become high-cost  
- Quantify intervention savings opportunity  
- Simulate a real payer strategy use-case  

---

## Dataset
Commercial maternity claims dataset including:

- ~2,000 delivery episodes  
- Medical claims  
- Pharmacy claims  
- Member enrollment  
- Episode-level cost aggregation  

---

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn / Matplotlib  
- Healthcare claims logic  

---

## Key Insights

### Primary Cost Drivers Identified
- C-section deliveries associated with significantly higher episode cost
- Gestational diabetes linked to elevated maternal episode spend
- Length of stay identified as strongest driver of high-cost episodes

### Key Business Impact for Healthcare Payers

- Top 10% of pregnancies drive disproportionate share of total spend
- Predictive model built to flag high-cost risk early in pregnancy
- High-risk pregnancies account for ~$15.7M in total episode spend
- Targeted intervention opportunity: ~15% potential cost reduction (~$2.36M savings)
- Demonstrates real-world payer strategy: early risk identification + cost containment

**Top 10% of episode cost (> ~$32K)**

### High-Cost Risk Differences
| Group | Avg Cost |
|------|---------|
| Normal pregnancies | ~$15.8K |
| High-cost pregnancies | ~$51.9K |

C-section high-cost rate:
- 23% high cost  
Vaginal high-cost rate:
- 6.8% high cost

### Diabetes Impact
| Group | Avg Cost |
|------|---------|
| No diabetes | ~$18.8K |
| Gestational diabetes | ~$23.6K |

Diabetes pregnancies:
- Higher C-section rate  
- Higher high-cost probability  
- Higher total spend  

---

## Predictive Model Built
Goal: Predict which pregnancies become high-cost.

Model inputs:
- C-section flag  
- Diabetes flag  
- Length of stay  

Feature importance:
1. C-section status → strongest driver  
2. Diabetes → moderate driver  
3. Length of stay → major cost amplifier

Model built to simulate real-world payer risk stratification workflows for early intervention and cost containment.

## Risk Stratification
Population grouped into:

| Risk Level | Cases |
|-----------|------|
| Low | 918 |
| Medium | 355 |
| High | 624 |

Average cost by risk tier:
- Low: ~$14.7K  
- Medium: ~$18.4K  
- High: ~$25.2K

## Savings Opportunity Simulation

High-risk pregnancies identified early:  
**624 cases**

Total high-risk spend:
**$15.7M**

If payer intervenes and reduces cost by 15%:
**Potential savings: $2.36M**

## Example Payer Interventions
- Early diabetes care management  
- High-risk pregnancy monitoring  
- Avoidable ER visit reduction  
- C-section review programs  
- Care navigation for high-risk members
